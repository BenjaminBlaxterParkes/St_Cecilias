The exhibition will focus on key themes to illustrate the contribution our School has made to Chemistry: Cradle of Chemistry (how Edinburgh has shaped the world), Chemistry and Economy (how Chemistry has contributed to economy and policy), Chemistry and Discovery (significant discoveries and achievements).

            Highlights will include Joseph Black's balance (Black was the first to employ the analytical balance in chemical investigations) and Alexander Crum Brown's first model of sodium chloride, made with knitting needles and balls of wool!
