                  The World History of Rashid al-Din, 1314: A Masterpiece of Islamic Painting, a major exhibition at the Main Library, University of Edinburgh in collaboration with Centre for Research Collections and the Alwaleed Bin Talal Centre for the Study of Islam in the
                  Contemporary World.

                  Curated by the Prince Alwaleed Centre and the Centre for Research Collections, the exhibition featured
                  folios from the Jami’ al-Tawarikh (or “World History”) of Rashid al-Din: one of the most important
                  illustrated medieval manuscripts to have survived from either East or West. Datable to 1314, it was
                  produced in the city of Tabriz, a seat of power of the Ilkhanid rulers, descendants of the Mongol Chingiz
                  Khan, who held sway over an empire encompassing Persia and large parts of present-day Azerbaijan and Turkey.

                    For thousands of years the obscure and unfamiliar has remained a source of inquiry. Early collecting
                    focused on the unclassified and unique, aiming to impress and enlighten. This exhibition will bring
                    together the unexpected and will showcase the rare and remarkable highlights from the University's
                    Collections.

                    The exhibition focused on key themes to illustrate the contribution our University has made to Chemistry:
                    Cradle of Chemistry (how Edinburgh has shaped the world), Chemistry and Economy (how Chemistry has
                    contributed to economy and policy), Chemistry and Discovery (significant discoveries and achievements).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Highlights include Joseph Black's balance (Black was the first to employ the analytical balance in
                    chemical investigations) and Alexander Crum Brown's first model of sodium chloride, made with knitting
                    needles and balls of wool!

                    This exhibition is a selection from the University's large collections. It is just a tiny sample from
                    a long history of collecting. The first University museum was begun before the end of the 17th century,
                    but this is not just a story of casual acquisition. Collecting objects and images of objects, animal,
                    vegetable or mineral, in order to study them, has long been central to learning. And not just in the
                    study of the past. Collecting has also played a crucial part in the advancement of knowledge in medicine
                    and the sciences. Indeed, this has been its primary role.
