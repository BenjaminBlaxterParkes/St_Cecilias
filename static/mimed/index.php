        <p>St Cecilia’s Hall is home to the collections of early keyboard and plucked strings, part of Edinburgh University                  Collection of Historic Musical Instruments, which ranks among the world's most important
            collections of musical heritage. The sister collection is currently on display and in store at the Reid Concert                  Hall Museum of Instruments. As part of the Redevelopment Project the two collections will be brought together as one, creating a single visitor destination at St Cecilia’s Hall. It has official Recognised Collection of National            Significance to Scotland status. </p>
        <p>The emphasis of the Collection is on instruments that are no longer in regular current use and the collecting                  policy is to acquire instruments when they fall out of use rather than to collect instruments by contemporary                  makers. The Collection thus covers the period from the 16th century (the earliest from which examples are                  available for acquisition) to the 20th century (the most recent from which instruments can be regarded as                  historic).</p>
        <p>Many of the instruments are still playable and through an established concert programme and as a regular                  venue during the Edinburgh International Festival, the Concert Room provides a contemporaneous setting for                  performances, within which the audience can be seen as the interface between the University and the public.                  For instance, St Cecilia’s Hall is the only place in the world where it is possible to hear 18th century music in an 18th century concert hall played on 18th century instruments.</p>
        <p>Highlights include:</p>
        <p>              • harpsichords by Ruckers and Taskin,<br />
            • guitars and lutes by Sellas, Staufer, Lacote, Harz and Railich,<br />
            • bowed strings by Bassano and Tielke,<br />
            • woodwind instruments by Haka, Stanesby, Simiot, Bassano &amp; Denner and<br />
            • brass by Schnitzer, Winkings and Sax.</p>
        <p>The instruments are supplemented by an archive of original materials, working                  papers and a sound archive. The Collection as a whole attracts researchers from far and wide and is an                  extensively cited resource in international scholarship. Instruments are lent to prestigious exhibitions at home
            and internationally. </p>
