        <h1>About the Collections</h1>
        <p>
            Special Collections include manuscripts and archives, rare books, photographs, printed and handwritten music,
            architectural drawings, theses and microfilms. The collections relate to University of Edinburgh and its history,
            and to Scotland and the wider world.

        <p>
            In total we have about 35 kilometres of historic material, much of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world.
