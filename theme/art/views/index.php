        As well as supporting research at all levels of the University, we believe that the uniqueness of our art collections
        lies in their innovative use. We seek to interpret and display collections in new and exciting ways, introducing
        contemporary insights and conversations to constantly reinvigorate debate. This involves working closely with
        Edinburgh College of Art and The Talbot Rice Gallery to ensure that collections are developed through contemporary
        collecting and also utilised by some of the world’s leading contemporary artists, academics and curators and
        presented to as wide an audience as possible.
