            <h1>Medical records revived: case note catalogues at Lothian Health Services Archive</h1>

            <p>
                Lothian Health Services Archive (LHSA) has developed a methodology for cataloguing archival case notes that
                describes them for researchers whilst protecting the privacy of individual patients. Individual catalogues
                can be accessed from this page. Read more about case note cataloguing projects here.</p>

            <p>The support of the Wellcome Trust is gratefully acknowledged. Research Resources funding has enabled the
                cataloguing of Norman Dottâ€™s case notes and those of the Royal Victoria Hospital, the Royal Victoria Dispensary
                for Diseases of the Chest, the Regional Hospital National X-ray Campaign and Southfield Sanitorium. For more
                information about these projects, see (link to LHSA page when it is up). </p>
